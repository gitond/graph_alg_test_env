Dijkstra function plan:

Metadata (Doxygen compatible "documentation"):
IN: 
	graph to be operated on (verts)
	source node (source)
	destination node (dest)
OUT: set of vertices with visit and path data (S_DJK)
NOTE: expected to run graph constructor again outside of Dijkstra function to get graph with path data

Implement pseudocode found in thesis as well as source [2]. 
Reference both thesis and [2] in metadata, code comments and academic sources in README
In code comments: What variable corresponds with what variable in thesis and [2] ?
