Graph Test:
ID: EFO1
Tests: If program is able to read and write graph data to/from external file
Components: GDM:GraphClass, GDM:RandomGraphGenerator, EFO:GraphOperations
Versions: 
	v1:without RGG,
	v2:vith RGG
Succeeds if: graph written and reconstructed by GraphOperations is the same graph
Fails: otherwise

Measurement Data test:
ID: EFO2
Tests: If program is able to output useable measurement data
Components: GDM:GraphClass, AM:Dijkstra, EFO:MeasurementOperations
Versions: possibly different versions with different algorithm modules
Succeeds if: external application (probably R) able to read data outputted by EFO and use it in calculations (probably average or smthng)
Fails: otherwise

Image Output Test:
ID: EFO3
Tests: If program is able to output images
Components: GDM:GraphClass, GDM:GraphVisualization
Versions: -
Succeeds if: output image dimensions are correct
Fails: otherwise
